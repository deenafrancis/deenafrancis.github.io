            <h3> Identification of the stages of Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning Techniques </h3>
            <p>
                Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous
                system. This work performs a four-class classification using the motor assessments
                of subjects obtained from the Parkinson’s Progressive Markers Initiative (PPMI)
                database and a variety of techniques like Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support
                Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Belief Network (DBN) etc. The effect of using
                feature selection was also studied. Due to the skewness of the data, while evaluating
                the performance of the classifier, along with accuracy other metrics like precision,
                recall and F1-score were also used. The best classification performance was
                obtained when a feature selection technique based on Joint Mutual Information
                (JMI) was used for selecting the features that were then used as input to the
                classification algorithm like SVM. Such a combination of SVM and feature
                selection algorithm based on JMI yielded an average classification accuracy of
                87.34 % and an F1-score of 0.84.
